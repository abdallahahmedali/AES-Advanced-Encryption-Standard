# AES-Advanced-Encryption-Standard
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) modules implementation using Verilog.

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) specifies a FIPS-approved 
cryptographic algorithm that can be used to protect electronic data. The AES algorithm is a 
symmetric block cipher that can encrypt (encipher) and decrypt (decipher) information. 
Encryption converts data to an unintelligible form called ciphertext; decrypting the ciphertext 
converts the data back into its original form, called plaintext.
